# 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of Domino’s Pizza using SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from sales data, such as total revenue, order trends, category-wise performance, and size-wise sales distribution.

By leveraging MySQL as the backend database and Power BI as the reporting tool, we ensure that decision-makers have access to real-time, data-driven insights to optimize business performance.
